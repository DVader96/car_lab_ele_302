#### Tuesday, April 17th (Chege)

* I added [control_car.py](https://github.com/dchege711/car_lab_ele_302/blob/navigation/pi_software/control_car.py). 
* I wasn't able to test and find good parameters to drive the car.
* I'll email Radd for directions on how to make KK connections to the Pi's pins.
